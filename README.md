## The Odin Project: Battleship

- This is a battle ship game built with JavaScript.
- The main goal of this assignment was to practice, the fundamentals of Test Driven Development.
- Jest was used for testing.
- Webpack was used, as a bundler.
- One thing new I learned while making this project is how the use Webpack's HTMLwebpackplugin to use a second html file for bundling.
